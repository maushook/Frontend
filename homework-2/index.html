		I love this recipe. I actually work with mostly Indian and Nepali women who raved about it when I brought some in- the ultimate compliment! I make half the recipe but used ½ teaspoon turmeric, 8 cloves of garlic, 2 yellow onions, and omitted the mint. The flavor after my alterations I'm sure was less delicate, but that's just what I prefer. Bravo!
